			<h1> About Me </h1>
			<h3>From one island to another.</h3>
			<p>My name is Ali, and I'm a Journalism + Design student at The New School.</p>
			<p>The statement “I want to be a journalist” is not one that’s heard often on Maui. Many want to be firefighters, police officers, or (the most popular) hold a management position in the hospitality industry. With one newspaper monopolizing print news on the island, and only a handful of locally-based “breaking news” websites, there is a limit to the news you receive and the variety of news that is generated.</p>
			<p>Being brought up by a mother from Houston and a father from Long Island, I grew up knowing that there was more going on in world than the stereotypical small-town stories in the Sunday paper. As I matured I became increasingly curious of the world outside the Maui bubble. Coinciding with my interest in world events was my love for writing. All it took was one high school English teacher to cover my paper in red ink, and I was hooked. I wanted to—no, I needed to perfect that paper. And the next paper. And the rest that followed.</p>
			<p>I decided early on that journalism was the route for me. Over the years I have swayed to fashion design, interior design, and I even explored becoming a teacher, but when it comes down to picking a college and a curriculum, journalism always wins me back. I want to explore, analyze and adventure, and then share my findings with others. Raised on nightly stories from my father, I too have found the joy in storytelling, and I have discovered I am able to experience that thrill while writing.</p>
