	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>I'm Ali and I am a Journalism + Design student at The New School Eugene Lang College of Liberal Arts. I was born on Long Island here in New York, but I grew up in Hawaii on the island of Maui. I took some time after high school to reevaluate what exactly I wanted out of life. I had two options: live on the island I've always known, go to local community college, and probably settle down early; or, I could uproot my comfortable lifestyle at home and move clear across the globe to New York City. Obviously my choice is clear.</p>
	<p>Leaving home was the best decision I've ever made. I'm attending the school of my dreams, meeting people from all walks of life, and living in a city with endless opportunity. Stay tuned to my blog for updates and observations about my new life in the big city!</p>
