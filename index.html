	<h1>Welcome to my blog!</h1>

<h2>THE LATEST:</h2> 
<p><h2>Sunday Morning on the Metro-North</h2></p>
<p>Over the long weekend I took a trip to Westchester County. I needed to get out of the city; it had been far too long since I had interacted with nature, and thanks to a friend I had the opportunity to spend the weekend surrounded by towering trees and vast waterways.</p>
<p>To get to my weekend oasis I had to take the Metro-North Harlem line. Traveling by train is by far my favorite mean of transportation. There’s something about sitting there, earphones in, and watching the world pass by at just the right speed — fast, but slow enough to truly take in the scenery in its raw form.</p>
<p>When the train first emerged from the underground darkness, a sight quite different from Grand Central terminal greeted me: Harlem. I watched the building-high murals move swiftly past, saw people carrying their groceries and pushing strollers, and noticed just how many plastic bags were in the trees outside the projects. Weird, I thought, that’s a lot of plastic clinging to those trees.</p>
<p>And then the project buildings themselves: some units with their windows open and various national flags bellowing out, and in one case a mop that looked to be freshly used drying out of a 20-something story window. The bricks looked worn, the ones with bars on the windows looked like prison cells, and the grassy courtyards surrounding the buildings looked gray instead of green, and most were littered with, you guessed it, more plastic bags.
As I looked out over Harlem from the heights of the train track, I felt as if I had, in just 10 minutes or so, passed through a neighborhood and got an accurate depiction of it.</p>
<p>The train then halted at the 125th street stop, and something profound happened...</p>
