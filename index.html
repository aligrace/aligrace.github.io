			<h1> Writing Sample: Young, Homeless, and Queer in New York </h1>
				<p> Among the millions of New York residents, commuters, and its tens of thousands of homeless, there is an underreported subpopulation. They may be students or employees (or both), they are young—no older than 25, and they are queer. 
 Although LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) youth account for only 5 to 7% of the nation’s overall youth population, they account for up to 40% of homeless unaccompanied youth, according to the Center for American Progress. In New York City there are an estimated 1,700 homeless youth that are not accompanied by guardians, and some studies have estimated that as high as 50% of the city’s homeless youth may identify LGB as their sexual orientation. The Center for American Progress’ most recent 2013 study shows that 33% of NYC homeless youth identify as LGBT for both sexual orientation and/or gender identity. 

LGBT youth are especially susceptible to homelessness, exponentially more so than their heterosexual youth counterparts. This is due to a variety of reasons including family rejection, discrimination, physical, mental, and sexual abuse, and financial limitations.
	Havens like Sylvia’s Place Shelter, whose clientele are specifically runaway and homeless LGBT youth between 18 and 24 years old, have remained near maximum capacity since their doors have opened. The Metropolitan Community Church, wherein lies Sylvia’s, is an LGBT Christian church situated between Hell’s Kitchen and Chelsea near the Lincoln Tunnel. The emergency shelter provides homeless youth with beds and hot meals on its ground floor. Up a narrow stairway lies a room for their church services, and further up, a quirky, bright red room that serves as both a showroom for colorful abstract art, and an office space for administrators Frances Wood and Mike Easterling.
Opening in 2002, Sylvia’s started off with with six beds in the Metropolitan Community Church, gradually increasing to their current total of 14. “We make it accessible” for homeless LGBT youth, said Wood, referring to their services, from shelter and a hot meal to free HIV testing without requiring referrals and operating on a first-come-first-serve basis. 
	Ali Forney Center, another LGBT youth shelter located in Harlem, also opened in 2002 and has been a model for the future of sheltering homeless queer youth. Originally starting with six beds, AFC has grown to 107 beds, currently working toward a total of 119. They assisted over 1,200 clients over the course of 2015. 
With a steady 95% occupancy rate, AFC shelters roughly 102 LGBT youth each night. However, over 230 young adults are on their waitlist.
	If they aren’t fortunate enough to land a bed at a shelter like AFC or Sylvia’s, homeless LGBT youth face an exceptionally cruel life on the streets. Living in a city-run shelter may be an option, but according to Easterling, although shelters are required by law to be “culturally competent,” discrimination can hinder queer youth from receiving these services, especially if they are transgender. And if it’s not a shelter, it’s couch surfing, sleeping on the streets, or (commonly) resorting to survival sex.
Compared to AFC, Sylvia’s is a very small shelter. However, despite being on a smaller scale, Sylvia’s beds have been filled over 2,300 times over the course of 2016 alone. Priority is given to transgender youth, as they are among the most marginalized of demographics.

Further marginalized are the transgender youth that are people of color. While homeless LGBT youth are overrepresented in the overall homeless youth population, homeless LGBT youth of color account for an exceptionally disproportionate percentage, particularly African American youth. When you compare homeless LGBT youth to the general population of homeless New Yorkers, and furthermore to the overall population of NYC, the disparity speaks for itself.
	According to Wood, 95% of Sylvia’s clients are people of color, and it’s nearly the same at AFC. The homeless population in NYC is predominantly African American and Hispanic, and the trend becomes even more prevalent when narrowed down to homeless LGBT youth.

As a whole, New York City reached a record high in homelessness this year, with over 60,000 people living in shelters throughout the city, according to the Coalition for the Homeless. It is estimated that in New York City alone, over 75,000 people, both sheltered and unsheltered, are homeless, and the city accounts for about 14% of the nation’s homeless population.
With over 75,000 homeless people, New York City has the largest homeless population in the nation, the second largest being Los Angeles with just over 40,000, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Among other major cities in the US, New York continues to lead with the highest percentage of homeless LGBT youth as well. Other cities with a substantial number of  homeless LGBT youth are Los Angeles, Chicago, and Seattle.

	However, as of January 2016 New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio vowed to continue to address youth homelessness in the city by budgeting for 100 new beds per year to be added to the shelter system, specifically for homeless youth. Mayor de Blasio has added over 200 beds since taking office, and with a preliminary budget of $14.7 million, 300 more beds will be available by 2019. Although these beds will not be LGBT youth-specific, it will make a difference for shelters like AFC.
In a statement in response to the Mayor’s January announcement, Carl Siciliano, executive director of AFC, said, “Having fought so long and hard to make NYC a place where no young person is forced to sleep in the streets, I am immensely gratified that the Mayor is expanding youth shelter capacity in this manner.”
	 Nonetheless, the hunt for funding is never-ending, especially for the Metropolitan Community Church’s small shelter. Sylvia’s lost their government funding in October, and are now in the process of completing new grant applications. Unfortunately, while specializing in LGBT youth may make a shelter’s application more attractive, so to speak, government funding for LGBT youth shelters in particular is slim to none. Therefore, Sylvia’s aims for “street outreach” or HIV-related grants, or non-specific transitional housing grants.
	According to the Center for American Progress, out of the Federal government’s $4.2 billion budget for homeless-related assistance programs, $195 million (less than 5%) is dedicated to homeless youth in particular. Wood stressed that the homeless LGBT community is in need of LGBT-specific funding. And by maintaining a database, small shelter’s like Sylvia’s could have a more convincing argument. 
Prior to 2015, Runaway and Homeless Youth Services used a data-upload system known as RHYPOINT, but it is now no longer active. To upload data, New York City now uses a system called AWARDS, a proprietary system that Sylvia’s simply can’t afford. According to Wood, Sylvia’s was quoted a startup cost of $11,000, and a monthly maintenance fee of $1,100 thereafter to upload their data. 
“I find it all terribly confusing,” said Wood. And furthermore, it’s financially impractical.
Dr. Jurgen von Mahs, associate professor of Urban Studies at The New School who specializes in poverty and homeless research, expressed frustration with funding, or lack thereof, that goes toward marginalized communities such as homeless LGBT youth.
	“There’s a number of government run homeless-focused entities,” he said, “but still, most of the work is done by non-profits.”
	Dr. von Mahs says money is what will make a difference to truly tackle the issue of homeless LGBT youth, and that it could happen effectively with help from private donors, rather than government aid. But, he conceded, very matter-of-factly, “The private sector won’t adapt unless there’s an economic motive.” 
So for now, shelters both big and small do what they can, continuing their never-ending hunt for adequate funding so they can provide shelter, support, and hope for New York’s hundreds of homeless LGBT youth.
